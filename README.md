<!-- Overview -->
## Overview
This thesis focuses on the evaluation of IEEE 802.11ac WLAN performance using TCP and UDP for both versions of the Internet Protocol (IPv4, IPv6) in three scenarios, namely, the effect 
of implementing WPA2 security encryption, the impact of shadowing (walls) and distance in laboratory environment, and human movement effects in indoor environmental conditions. 
This thesis will also provide knowledge about the behaviour of commonly used protocols on a new wireless standard (802.11ac) in real network environments. 
The performance metrics of wireless network test-beds such as throughput, round trip time, and CPU utilisation are gathered and analysed.

## Details
The thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Computing in Unitec Institute of Technology. 
In this project, Two phases of this scenario were carried out, for the purpose of establishing a baseline and to help in analysing the impact of adding a WPA2 encryption on 
the UDP and TCP traffic for both IPv4 and IPv6 over 802.11ac WLANs. The first phase of the experiment was for measuring the throughput, RTT, and CPU utilisation 
under normal conditions (no security applied in AP), which aimed at achieving a highest throughput in typical conditions. 
The second phase of the experiment was to analyse these matrices when WPA2 encryption was applied in order to measure the impact of WPA2 encryption over an 802.11ac Wi-Fi network.

## Findings
The findings of this study concludes that the shadowing environment and distance have a severe impact of 802.11ac WLAN performance. Applying WPA2 security also reduces the performance metrics measurement. 
The presence of human movement has an insignificant impact of the 802.11ac WLAN performance. 
IPv4 outperforms IPv6 on different levels, depending on the network environment. TCP provides lower performance than UDP.
